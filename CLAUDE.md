# Laguna Genealogies — project context

A digital edition of the genealogical plates published with Elsie Clews Parsons,
**"Laguna Genealogies"**, *Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of
Natural History*, vol. 19, pt. 5 (1923), pp. 133–292.

**Live:** https://pueblogenealogy.github.io/ · **Repo:**
`PuebloGenealogy/pueblogenealogy.github.io` (public) · Pages from `main` /
`/docs`, HTTPS enforced.

Published: **Genealogy I** (Table 1) — 104 individuals, 27 marriages, 80
parent–child links, 5 generations. **Genealogy IV** (Table 4) — 73 individuals,
14 marriages, 58 parent–child links, 4 generations. Tables 2 and 3 await scans.

## Start here

1. **`docs/` is generated.** All design, copy and markup live in
   `scripts/make_chart.py` (~2,600 lines). Editing `docs/` is discarded silently
   on the next build.
2. **The edition publishes the 1923 transcription only** — never research
   columns. See below; this is the thing that must not go wrong.
3. **`SESSION-NOTES.md` is where the last session stopped** — read it first.
   It names the open thread and the decisions not to re-litigate. Rolling, not
   a history; `/wrap-session` overwrites it.
4. `CHANGELOG.md` has the history. Read it instead of asking what changed.

---

## The one thing to get right

**No English names, no census matches, ever.** Some people identifiable through
that research have living descendants, the repo is public, and git history is
permanent — a leak cannot be undone by a later commit.

Enforced structurally, and must stay that way:

- Research columns live in `data/parsons_genealogy_I.xlsx`, which is git-ignored
- The public build reads `scripts/transcription*.py`, which have no research
  columns to read — there is no code path from workbook to `docs/`
- `make_chart.py --public` greps its own output for `class="eng"` /
  `class="census"` and **deletes the file** rather than write one

Before committing new material, confirm `git status` lists no `.xlsx` and
nothing under `build/` or `data/`. `/publish` runs this gate.

## Hard rules

| Never | Why |
|---|---|
| **Hand-edit anything in `docs/`** | Generated; overwritten every build. Edit `make_chart.py` |
| Blank `GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` | The tag is emitted by the build; blanking it lapses Search Console ownership |
| Re-run `scripts/build_workbook.py` | Overwrites the workbook, discarding research columns |
| Run OCR on a plate | Drops the diacritics and discards the bracket geometry |
| "Correct" a misprint in the data | The edition reproduces the plate; misprints are annotated, not fixed |
| Alter names, diacritics, numbering, clans or cross-references | Accuracy is the whole point |

## Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/transcription.py          # structural self-check, Table 1
python3 scripts/transcription_iv.py       # structural self-check, Table 4
python3 scripts/make_chart.py --public    # the published build -> docs/
python3 scripts/subset_font.py            # only when the data gains new characters
```

`--public` must end `N JSON-LD blocks valid` and **exit 0**. It exits 1 on
invalid structured data or a research-data leak. `make_chart.py` with no flag is
the private build; it needs `data/*.xlsx`, which is not in this clone.

**Preview:** `preview_start`, config name `site` — serves `docs/` on
`http://localhost:4173`. Loop: edit `make_chart.py` → rerun `--public` → reload.

**Publish:** `/publish` — gated build, privacy check, push, live verification.

**Finish a session:** `/wrap-session` — backfills `CHANGELOG.md`, rewrites
`SESSION-NOTES.md` as a handoff, and checks this file for claims the session
falsified. Run it before stopping, not after.

A `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`) reads
`SESSION-NOTES.md` into context at the start of every session, and flags it as
stale when `scripts/` or `docs/` has moved since the notes were last committed.
It fails open — if it errors, the session starts normally with no handoff. Note
what it cannot do: hooks on session events are **shell commands only**, so it
can guarantee the handoff is read but never write one. That is still
`/wrap-session`'s job.

**New plate:** `/transcribe-plate`. `make_chart.py` is table-agnostic: add a
`TABLES` entry, drop the matching `PENDING` one, write
`scripts/transcription_<n>.py` on the same schema. Counts in the page copy are
computed from data, never typed.

## Where things are

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `scripts/make_chart.py` | **The whole renderer** — CSS, JS, HTML, SEO, layout |
| `scripts/transcription*.py` | The 1923 baseline as data. Immutable — *except* to record what the plate actually prints, e.g. `PLATE_NUMBER_MISPRINTS` |
| `docs/` | Generated site. Never hand-edit |
| `assets/og-cover.jpg` | Social card, derived once from the plate scan (see `OG_IMAGE`) |
| `sources/` | Source scans, in repo but not served |
| `METHOD.md` | Editorial method — why readings are made as they are |
| `.zenodo.json` | Metadata for the archived deposit. Read from the **tagged commit**, so it must land on `main` before a release is cut |
| `CITATION.cff` | How to cite. Carries the concept doi plus both dois under `identifiers` |

Identity is three constants at the top of `make_chart.py`: `SITE`, `REPO` and
`DOI`. Every canonical, sitemap entry and card derives from them. `DOI` is the
Zenodo **concept** doi, which always resolves to the newest release — never
hard-code a version doi here, or every citation printed on the site rots at the
next release.

## Layout

The chart reproduces the plate's column grid. Every `.node` is
`[.block][.kidcol]`; each nested node adds exactly one `--stub` plus one
`--col`-wide block, so generation *d* lands at `d × (--col + --stub)` on every
path. **Column drift must measure 0 px at every generation.** If it doesn't,
that invariant broke — don't patch it with per-element margins.

Sibling brackets hang off the **mother's** line, not the top of a block, and the
leader rules use the same `mother_row` index. Getting this wrong looks like a
styling detail while actually asserting a different genealogy.

Measure in the browser, don't judge by eye: walk `.node` depth and compare each
`.block`'s left offset.

## Design invariants

Four rules that look like styling preferences and are not:

1. **The root font size is pinned at 16px.** `GEOM` states the plate grid in rem
   against it, so changing the root rescales `--col` and `--stub` and breaks the
   drift invariant. The `--t-*` ramp exists to size **chrome and prose only** —
   nothing inside `.sheet` is sized from it.
2. **A selected or hovered `.line` may change `background`, `box-shadow` and
   `outline` — nothing else.** Padding, border or height there moves the row and
   throws the sibling bracket off its `mother_row`. That reads as a styling
   detail while actually asserting a different genealogy. All three selection
   highlights — chart row, register entry, targeted footer note — draw
   **outside** the border box for a second reason: an `inset` shadow paints its
   bar over the first glyphs, and a hugging outline sits on the text.
3. **`--rule` is not text.** `body.chart` flattens all text to `--ink` by
   redefining `--muted`; the brackets and leader rules are deliberately excluded,
   because they carry the genealogy's structure.
4. **`--tap` floors every hit area** in the site chrome, and `--bar-h` derives
   from it so anchor `scroll-margin` tracks the bar. Don't restate either.

One thing that will look like a bug and isn't: below 26rem the word "Genealogy"
in the table pills is visually hidden but kept in the accessible name, so the
sticky bar stays two rows on a phone.

**There is no on-page chart key, by decision.** One was built as a `<details>`
above the plate and removed the same day; the notation it explained now lives in
the footer's *Navigating this chart* list, which is therefore the **only** place
`+` (spouse), `F.`/`M.` (sex) and the leader rule are decoded. Thinning those
three lines re-opens a defect that has already been introduced twice. Don't
rebuild the key without saying what changed — the reason it went is that it is
decode-once material and the plate is what the reader came for.

`.plate-caption` now carries the pan hint and nothing else, so the **caption**
is what hides above 1400px and in print; hiding only `.pan-hint` would leave an
empty figcaption holding its bottom padding open.

In the plate bar, Find sits left and Scale right, and the split is an **auto
start-margin on `#scale-mount`, never `justify-content:space-between`**. `#find`
carries `[hidden]` until the script unhides it, so space-between would strand
the scale buttons on the left for a reader without JavaScript.

A table page's title block is the plate label, the numeral, the double rule and
the **statistics line** — no citation. The landing page keeps its citation.

`--muted-fixed` is the real `--muted`, captured at `:root`. Invariant 3 flattens
`--muted` to `--ink` on `body.chart`; a `var()` is substituted with the value the
element it is *declared on* computes, so anything that must keep the dimmer grey
through the flatten reads `--muted-fixed`. Only `.imprint` does, deliberately —
so the statistics line matches the landing page's `.c-stats` grey while
everything else on a table page stays `--ink`. Adding more users of it is
re-opening the colour decision; measure the contrast if you do (`.imprint` is
6.15:1 light, 6.73:1 dark).

**The theme control has no Auto state.** It toggles Light ↔ Dark and the button
always names a real palette. The system preference is still honoured: it is what
a first visit resolves to, and no choice is written to storage until the reader
presses the button, so an untouched control keeps following the OS.

The footer apparatus is a **two-column grid of `.app-sec` sections** at
`--measure-wide`, collapsing to one column below 56rem. Grid of whole sections,
not CSS multicolumn — multicolumn will break a heading away from the list it
introduces. This is also what puts the footer on the same left edge as the
register above it.

The misprint ring is an **`outline`**, never a border or padding: a border
widens the row and throws the sibling bracket off its `mother_row`. The
annotation is a separate row counted with `row += 1`, exactly as a
cross-reference row is, so everything below stays on the `--lh` grid — verified
by walking all 24 child groups and confirming each still sits on its mother's
line. `--sic` is the only colour on a table page that is not `--ink`; it is
text, so it clears 4.5:1 on both papers alone (6.43:1 light, 7.19:1 dark).

Person references in the apparatus are linked by `_p()` at each call site,
**never by regex over the prose**. The apparatus is full of numbers that are not
people — 1923, vol. 19, pp. 133–292, U23, `d. 1908` — and a pattern loose enough
to catch "58+59" links those too.

## Facts worth knowing

- **Clan descent is matrilineal**, so a child's clan must equal its mother's.
  This independently checks every bracket reading and is what caught errors in
  Table 1. A clan mismatch means the reading is wrong, not the rule.
- **Person 8 (Yu˙si) appears twice** on Table 1; drawn once, with a
  cross-reference standing in for the repeat.
- **Misprint at 76 (Table 1):** the `+` line is numbered 68 but names person 67.
  The chart **prints 68** — the plate's number — ringed in `--sic` red, links it
  to person 67, and carries *(misprint, click here to see notes)* on its **own
  row below**, pointing at `#note-misprint`. Opening the person card from that
  line shows 68 and repeats the note; from person 67's other lines it shows 67,
  and the register always keeps 67. Declared in `transcription.py`'s
  `PLATE_NUMBER_MISPRINTS`, read through `union["printed_number"]`, carried to
  the card on `data-printed`; a table without one needs no entry. Do not "fix"
  this to 67: printing 67 makes the chart disagree with the scan, which is the
  one thing the edition exists not to do.
- **English names in parentheses are plate data**, not research additions —
  person 90 "Heʼsa (Hazel)" on Table 1, and the Johnsons and Mana on Table 4.
- **`d.`** means the person had already died when Parsons recorded the
  genealogy, during her fieldwork of 1918–19; the year is given where known. A
  number after a name is their age at recording.
- **Phonetic glyph rendering is settled — don't re-open it.** Coverage was
  proven from the cmap: all 85 characters in the transcription and all 94
  rendered on Genealogy I are in both faces, `ᶦ` U+1DA6, `ᵘ` U+1D58, `ᵃ` U+1D43,
  `ʼ` U+02BC and `˙` U+02D9 included. The faces are base64 data URIs, so nothing
  is fetched and nothing can 404, and no combining marks are used, so there is
  no mark positioning to vary by platform. The one thing the cmap could not
  answer — whether a real browser on **Windows or Android** honours the embedded
  face — was **checked on device by the user on 2026-07-28: everything rendered
  correctly on both.** Note macOS substitutes for any font, so no on-screen
  comparison here can demonstrate the absence of substitution — if this is ever
  questioned again, read the cmap, don't measure widths.
- Google's structured-data validator is **stricter than schema.org** — valid
  schema.org has been rejected twice here. `check_structured_data()` guards the
  rules we have been told about, not all of them; a Search Console report
  outranks the build's opinion.

## Environment

macOS, Python 3.11. openpyxl 3.1.5, fontTools 4.63.0 + brotli. `gh` 2.96.0 at
`~/.local/bin/gh`, authenticated as `prettyph3nom`, owner of the
`PuebloGenealogy` org. **No Homebrew, no ImageMagick, no PIL** — use `sips`.

The repo lives under Google Drive, whose sync daemon can touch `.git` mid-write;
if git reports object corruption, that is the likely cause.

`_backup-v1-laguna-genealogy-tables-2026-07-27/`, one level up, is the **sole
surviving copy** of the deleted v1 repo. Do not clean it up as stale.

## State

Site live and indexed-submitted; Search Console and Bing both verified;
structured data valid and guarded at build time. v1 is deleted.

**Archived at Zenodo**, concept doi `10.5281/zenodo.21637900`, first release
`v1.0.0` (2026-07-28). The doi appears in `CITATION.cff`, the README badge, the
**footer** citation block on every table page (`cite_html()` — the title-page
citation was removed on 2026-07-28 and never carried the doi), and as
`identifier` in the JSON-LD —
`Dataset` on the table pages, `CollectionPage` on the landing page, which is
the entity the deposit actually corresponds to. Archiving is automatic from now
on: Zenodo's webhook is on the repo, so **cutting a GitHub release mints a new
version doi**. `.zenodo.json` controls the record's metadata; without it Zenodo
would title the deposit after the repo.

**Outstanding:**
- **Inbound links** — a fresh `*.github.io` has no authority, and no on-page
  work substitutes. Zenodo is done and is itself the first such link. Next, by
  effort-to-return: a **Wikidata** item (heavily crawled, feeds Knowledge Graph,
  none of Wikipedia's conflict-of-interest friction), then the Wikipedia *Elsie
  Clews Parsons* external links — **propose on the Talk page**, since adding a
  link to one's own work is a COI and tends to be reverted — then the AMNH
  Digital Library, which hosts the original and could also supply the handle
  `.zenodo.json` currently omits from `related_identifiers`.
- **Custom domain** — **currently decided against**, and the reasoning is in
  `SESSION-NOTES.md`; listed here because it is not closed, only deferred.
  **Decide it before seeding any inbound links.** Every
  link and citation placed from now on points permanently at whatever host is
  chosen, and most will never be updated. Note the old framing of this as "the
  strongest SEO upgrade" overstated it: Google treats `github.io` as a public
  suffix, so no authority is inherited from it and none is lost by leaving. The
  real argument is citation permanence and portability — a domain you own can
  change hosts without breaking a doi-adjacent link — which is an argument for
  doing it first or not at all. Drops onto this repo via a `CNAME` file.
- Tables 2 and 3 await scans.

## Working style

Report what was measured, not what was attempted. Flag uncertain readings
explicitly rather than burying them.

**Check the built file, not only the rendered page.** A DOM read in the browser
happens after the page's own script has run, so it cannot see what the HTML
ships. That is how `Theme: Auto` survived a check that reported no "Auto"
anywhere: `applyTheme()` had already rewritten the label. For anything that
exists in the markup — labels, attributes, structured data, the leak markers —
grep `docs/`. The source scans in `sources/` are usually
the fastest authority — faster than catalog records, which describe publications
rather than plates.
